- Define a distributed system

    A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements
    that appears to its users as a single coherent system.
- What are the two fundamental charateristics of a distributed system?
    1. Autonomous computing nodes
    2. Single coherent system
- Mention some of the challenges when dealing with a distributed system
    1. Synchronization
    2. Group Membership
- Why is synchronization a problem in distributed system?
    - Each node operates independently
    - This means that each node has its own notion of time
    - This lack of a common clock makes synchronization and coordination difficult
- What are the two types of groups?
    1. Open group  
    Open group is one where nodes can freely join.  
    2. Closed group  
    Only members can communicate
- What are the types of overlays ?
    1. Structured Overlay
    1. Restructured Overlay
- What is middleware ?
