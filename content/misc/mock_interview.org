* Operating Systems
1. What is a process?
   - Process is a program in execution
2. What are the states of a process?
   1. Running
   2. Ready
   3. Waiting
3. What are threads?
   - Threads are paths of execution. They can be thought of lightweight
   processes.
4. Differentiate threads and processes?
   - Processes are executed in separate memory space whereas threads of
   the same process share the same memory space
5. What is thrashing?
   - When the systems spends more time in handling page faults than
   actual execution
6. What is /Belady's anamoly/ ?
   - Usually increasing the number of pages decrease the number of page faults.
   - But in some page replacement algorithm this is not the case.
   - The phenomenon by which the increase in the number of pages results in more page faults is known as /Belady's anamoly/.
   - Example: *FIFO page replacement*
7. What is a kernel?
   - Kernel is the first program that is run when an OS is booted. It is
   a resource manager, and acts as a bridge between the hardware and
   software of a system.
8. What is a deadlock?
   - A deadlock is a situation that can occur in a computer system when two or more processes are blocked and waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a deadlock where neither process can proceed.
9. Required conditions for a deadlock to occur
   1. Mutual Exclusion
   2. Hold and Wait
   3. No preemption
   4. Circular wait
10. What are starvation and aging in OS?
    - Starvation :: Process is not allocated resources for a long time.
    - Aging :: Priority of Low priority tasks are increased for every
      time quantum and this ensures that they will be served
      eventually
